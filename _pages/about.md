The **long-term** goal of my research is to develop novel computational methods to realise **education-at-scale**.
I want to make education **freely** accessible to all, especially to people in the developing world. Particularly, I am interested
in developing novel methods where **personalised** education can be provided to learners in their **native** language using automated methods.

To realise my goal, in several small steps, I have developed different novel computational methods to automatically model **readability** of **text** data.
I have developed new methods to model **word representations** including modelling automatic **text generation**. I have also developed new methods to **retrieve** information from **vast** amounts of text data. I am now working
towards modelling **images** and text **jointly** in a unified parameter space.
